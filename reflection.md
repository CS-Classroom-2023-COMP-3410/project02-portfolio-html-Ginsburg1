Overall, I found the project to be insightful to how website and how to use HTML. I developed the code through using Chatgpt and CoPilot, then went in and edited the code myself to make the code better fit my spefications and the specifications of the project. AI was not perfect, but very useful in completing the project.

Some of the issues that I encountered was issues with spacing. I had to learn how to fix the spacing and make items in different arangements. I fixed this by going into the code and looking to where there were issues with spacing and adding and adjusting lines of code.

Side note: I leanred the hard way that when loading in VS code, captialization does not matter, but does matter on the DU servers.
